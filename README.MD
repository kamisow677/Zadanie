# Vattenfall bookstore v2.0

## App overview
This is an application about books and authors. The code is written in kotlin and Spring Boot 3.x. It uses gradle to manage dependencies.
The app exposes a single endpoint for getting information about books and there is a persistence layer, but the database is not configured
(you can configure it if you need to, but it is not required to achieve the goal).

## The goal
Unfortunately the application was written by a not very experienced craftsman, so there are no tests. Your goal will be to configure the project and write the tests.
Assuming that other projects in company have tests written in Spock+Groovy here the same framework should be used.
Remember that the main goal is to write tests and cover all important code branches.
It is up to you to decide what type and how many tests you will write, what additional tools or libraries you will use and so on.
The goal is to have a well-tested bug-free project also easy to maintain in the future.

## Why
You may ask why such a task? So the reason is that we in the team put a lot of emphasis on testing because we see a lot of value in testing.
So the reason is simple We would like to see if your approach to application testing is similar to ours :-)

## How to
 1. Init git repository.
 2. Upload project to public remote git repository (Github, Gitlab etc.)
 3. Create feature branch
 4. Solve the task by pushing changes to the feature branch
 5. Create PullRequest/MergeRequest from feature branch to master/main branch
 6. Send link to the PullRequest/MergeRequest to your recruiting maintainer
